To run insertsort.py and mergesort.py:

1. Ensure that data file is titled 'data.txt' and is in the same directory as the sorting program of choice.
    Data file must organize input according to the following format:
        The first value of each line is the number of integers that need to be sorted, followed by the integers.
        Example for data.txt:
            4 19 2 5 11
            8 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2
2. Run insertsort.py/mergesort.py, which will read automatically from data.txt
    To run on the flip server, navigate to the correct directory then enter 'python3 `program.py`', where program.py
    is the program intended to be run.
3. 'insertsort.py' will output results to 'insert.out' in the same directory.
    Likewise, 'mergesort.py' will output results to 'merge.out' in the same directory.
    
    
To run insertTime.py and mergeTime.py:

1. No accompanying data file is required.
2. Run insertTime.py/mergeTime.py.
    To run on the flip server, navigate to the correct directory then enter 'python3 `program.py`', where program.py
    is the program intended to be run.
3. For both programs, results will be output to the console.
